### Detecting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images using CNN
<P>By training a CNN model on a large dataset of chest X-ray images, consisting of COVID-19-positive and negative cases, we seek to establish a reliable and efficient method for COVID-19 detection. The trained model will be able to classify new chest X-ray images as either COVID-19-positive or negative, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in making timely and informed decisions.</P>
